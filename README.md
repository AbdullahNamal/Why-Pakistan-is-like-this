# Why-Pakistan-is-like-this
Gapminder Foundation is a non-profit venture registered in Stockholm, Sweden, that promotes sustainable global development and achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals by increased use and understanding of statistics and other information about social, economic, and environmental development at local, national, and global levels.
We were given the data provided by Gapminder in .csv file by our course instructor Dr. Junaid. Our project was to understand the reason why after 70 years of 
independence Pakistan is still bankrupted and is not making not significant progress. But as computer science we have to prove it through reasoning.
So inorder to read the data we use the python lib called as pandas which is also used in datascience. And to visualize data, we have used texttable and graphs.
We also wrote a long report on the basic of our observations that we made after reading all the data of 70 years and all countries. We compare Pakistan with 
many countries by using many factors like inflation, poverty, income-per-person etc.
